thinking out loud here
OK so game broken into either 2 or 3 fundament sections
A crimes you can do
B research or locations - stuff you can also do
C managements

perhaps B is not needed


within A there are a few different kinds of crimes

there are basic crimes. they take time. you can possibly set them to auto repeat
you can add more people to make them go faster but its significantly less efficient the more poeple you add

opportunity crimes. the opportunity comes and goes. this rewards you on being around to catch it I guess





meta stuff

inventory and or warehouse

are these the same or different???



managing people. make this simple.



what about research???


investments?






something to deciode... how about LEVEL
